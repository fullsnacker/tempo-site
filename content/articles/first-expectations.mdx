Hello there! 👋 Since a log time I wanted to write about a topic that I love as a **Frontend Engineer**: building **user interfaces** (it scalability, good practices, and best approaches). So along this blog I want to share all that I have learnt this years about that.

### Let's see the repertoire

In order to cover all the topics that I want this year, I have been planning a list of all the topics that I'm going to be writing along this blog and here is a bite of them:

- **Themes:** what are they, how to use it and everything we have to know about them
- **Layout components**: and it benefits
- **Typographies:** scales and how to deal with
- **Icons:** good practices and usages
- **Design systems and component libreries:** patterns, analysis and how to build them
- **Design tokens:** what are they, how and when are worth to use it

### Articles, notes, snippets, and resources

Articles are not the only thing that I would be posting, also I'll be sharing weekly resources, the code snippets that I mostly use and quick notes about technologies or useful properties of CSS.

<br />

Also I prepared a monthly section where we are going to analyze the source code, the structure and the "anathomy" of populars component libraries to learn about them.

##### I'm excited to share with you this journey.
